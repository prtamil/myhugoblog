I'm Tamilselvan Rangasami and Im currently working as Software Architect. 
I'm a introvert. From the age of 16 I'm coding almost daily. 
Yet i'am suffering from the feeling that i'am not worthy enough. 
Anyway i enjoy programming. This saves my sanity.

At age of 16 i started my journey with C with Windows. I'm 40 years old now.
I have come a long way. During my College years i have learned Linux. From that time to till now Linux/Unix mesmerize me everyday. I also work on FreeBSD and i really like OpenBSD. 
For me OpenBSD/C is my Apocalypse Stack [Thanks Covid-19].

I have professional experience in C++ for almost 9 years. Then I switched to Python/JS.
Almost 8 years i'am using Python and Javascript. I have been using Python/Django/REST/GraphQL/Graphene
NodeJs/Express on backend. On FrontEnd i started my journey almost 5 years back.
From there it extends to React/Vue/Svelte/MithrilJs. Currently Im working with React.
And i kind of like new React with Hooks,Effects etc.. Im now officially a FullStack Programmer.

I want to learn and I want to learn everything. I have constant thirst of knowledge and i'am happy that i cannot satisfy it.

I'm Geek by Nature. If i'm not been a programmer. I can't think any other way to make a living.

I like StarWars Universe including Clone Wars and Star Wars rebels.

All my Depressions, Insecurities, Worries about Future, Guilt of the Past and Sorrows vanished after Reading Bhagavat Gita.
Now i'am a Peaceful Programmer.
